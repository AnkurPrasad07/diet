    <h2>About DIET <span class="highlighted">Kamki</span></h2>
    <p>The District Institute of Education and Training (DIET) have been established in Arunachal Pradesh for meeting the needs of professional growth of Elementary Level Teachers of the state. The BSB Changlang was converted into DIET in 1989. After the DIET Changlang the other five DIETs of the State (Naharlagun, Pasighat, Roing, Dirang and Seppa) were made operational during 2000. In the year 2008, one DIET Daporijo and four DRCs ( Kamki, Khupa, Yachuli and Khonsa) were made operational. In due course, all the DRCs (District Resource Centres) located in different districts were conferred the status of DIET (District Institute of Education & Training). Now there are eleven DIETs in Arunachal Pradesh. The main programmes and activities which are to be executed in DIETs are as under:
